The `hollow` square is the same as the square pattern but has stars only at the boundaries.


```http

```

Following are the steps to create a hollow square pattern in C++:

```http
1.Take the size of the square.
2.Create a nested loop where there are 2 loops in the external loop.
3.In the first internal loop, the spaces and second internal loop prints the star.
4.Break the line after completing both internal loops to create a new line.
```
