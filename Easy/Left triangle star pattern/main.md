Following are the steps to create a left triangle star pattern in C++:

1. Set the size of your triangle.
2. Create a nested loop with 1 internal loop that will print stars in the row.
3. Use cout << "\n" to break the line at the end of the internal loop.
4. The internal loop will run the number of times as the external loop has run.
